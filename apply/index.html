        <p align="center"><em>"What I find so amazing is that the people are really there to have an intimate look at your business, and they give you <u>so much perspective</u> that you wouldn't be able to find in any other sort of group."</em><br /><strong>Juliana Marulanda, ScaleTime</strong></p>

        <p align="center"><em>"In the five months since I joined OwnersUP I have <u>tripled my income</u>. I'm actually on track to even go up on my goals which I thought were impossible before."</em><br /><strong>Mollie McGlocklin, Lecture Loft</strong></p>

        <p align="center"><em>"I needed help with prioritization, branding, marketing, strategy, finances, and that's where OwnersUP came in. The most immediate result is that my revenue has gone up because I've been able to <u>get more focussed</u> having a team of people to bounce ideas off."</em><br /><strong>Vicki Johnson, ProFellow</strong></p>
