categories: wrapup

We have you categorize your accomplishments to help you understand how you are spending your time.

### Revenue

Any activity that is generating new money

> "I spent 20 minutes writing 10 emails to prospective clients"

### Retention

Any activity that keeps clients happy and around. This includes upselling them.

> "I spent 45 minutes planning with an existing client"

### Systems

Any activity that helps you scale your efforts so you can save time and make more money

> "I spent 3 hours streamlining my on-boarding process"

### Partnerships
Any activity that is done towards a potential referral source of new prospects

> "I spent 1 hour on the phone with a potential strategic partner"

### Other

Everything that doesn't fall into the above categories. Just because an activity is "Other" doesn't mean that it's not important. Bookkeeping, accounting, research and planning are critical business functions. However, they don't directly drive revenue and should not be taking up *most* of your time.

> "I spent 1 hour researching tools to use for project X"

> "I spent 30 minutes accounting"
