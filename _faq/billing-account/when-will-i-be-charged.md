The easiest way to tell is to login and go to the [billing section](https://dashboard.ownersup.com/account/billing). At the top you'll see your subscription info, including when the current cycle ends. You will be charged the next day.

Your OwnersUp subscription automatically charges once a month. If your account was setup on the 15th of September, you'll be charged again on the 15th of October.
