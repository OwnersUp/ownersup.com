We would ask that you provide at least 30 days notice before cancelling your account. Every time a member leaves a group, it effects it's dynamic. We want to do our best to maintain each group's stability and some heads up helps us do that as best as we're able.

We understand that life happens though and 30 days may be hard to do. Just make sure to talk to us and we'll do our best.
