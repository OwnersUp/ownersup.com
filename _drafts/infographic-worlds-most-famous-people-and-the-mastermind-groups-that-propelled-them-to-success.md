World's Most Famous People and the Mastermind Groups That Propelled Them to Success

It's hard to imagine that all our favorite Disney characters were born from one mind, because the truth is they're not. Walt Disney may be exceptionally brilliant, but he himself admitted that the success of his studio is a collaborative effort of the different creative minds behind him.

Just like Walt Disney, many of the world's successful personalities are accomplished because of the people who worked with them and behind them. This is called mastermind group.

The term was first coined by Napoleon Hill in “Think and Grow Rich” back in the early 1900s. He wrote, “The coordination of knowledge and effort of two or more people, who work toward a definite purpose, in the spirit of harmony."

Simply put, a mastermind group is a group of people collaborating and supporting each other to achieve a goal. Whether it’s face-to-face or an online mastermind group for entrepreneurs, they can take part in brainstorming sessions, give you peer evaluations, and make sure that everyone is on track.

Think about it. As an entrepreneur or CEO, you need expert advice to make sure that your business plan is heading in the right direction. You don't have all the skills, knowledge and specializations to crop up all creative outputs and see the big picture in different perspectives. Without a mastermind group, you would be probably doing guesswork, hoping that things will turn out well.

Here are some benefits of having a mastermind group:

Expertise and fresh ideas. It's not easy to keep up with the trends if you have so many responsibilities. Mastermind groups can contribute new ideas and proven strategies, including their skills and expertise. They can give constructive criticisms to shape your business into a successful venture.

Network and partnerships. Since the members of your mastermind groups have their own business networking groups, many opportunities to meet business partners are available.

Support. When things become hard to manage, your mastermind group can help you stay on track. They can serve as an online accountability group for entrepreneurs to inspire you to accomplish your goals.

Behind every successful business is a team. History can attest to that with a long list of luminaries and visionaries that we look up to. Check out this infographic to know more about the world's greatest mastermind groups behind successful icons.

J.R.R. Tolkien and The Inklings

Who’s not hooked at the brilliance of J.R.R. Tolkien’s epic high fantasy novel, The Lord of the Rings?

This world-famous novel, in fact, underwent criticisms and commentary from a group named the Inklings. Great poets and writers such as CS Lewis and Charles Williams were part of this informal literacy circle in Oxford.

Whimsy and unique, the term Inklings is a pun of those who dabble in ink or those who have an inkling of whatever they want to write about. It’s been said that the Inklings would meet regularly every week in Lewis’ room and at a local pub to read their works aloud and hear what others had to say.

King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table

Everyone has heard about King Arthur’s Knights of the Roundtable, a legendary group of the best knights, heroes, and champions in his kingdom. Each member holds equal status in the success of the group. These men of courage, honor, nobleness, courtesy, and dignity were formed to maintain peace and order of the kingdom.

Whether its myth or a legend, the Knights of the Roundtable is a perfect example of a mastermind group working toward a common goal.

Walt Disney and the Nine Old Men

Even Walt Disney knew that the success of his studio is a product of the minds that worked with him – the Nine Old Men. He even said once, "I am in no sense of the word a great artist. I have always had artists working for me whose skills were greater than my own."

Don’t get the name wrong because the members of the Nine Old Men were in their 20s when it was formed. Walt derived the name from U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt's nine Supreme Court judges.

The Nine Old Men were a group of talented artists and animators who created Walt Disney’s most famous masterpieces like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and The Rescuers.

Franklin Roosevelt and Brain Trusts

The 32nd president of the US wouldn’t have probably become the only US president to serve 12 years and 4 terms without his group of close advisers behind him – the Brain Trusts. Columbia University professors Raymond Moley, Rexford G. Tugwell and Adolph A. Berle, Jr. were the principal members of the group.

The expertise of Bran Trusts in various fields gave rise to a series of programs that helped the country overcome different challenges. It’s believed that without the Brain Trusts, the US would have faced a great depression during Roosevelt’s time.

Benjamin Franklin and the Junto

The Junto was born from Benjamin Franklin’s passion for conversations, philosophy and civic involvement. Also known as the “Leather Apron Club,” it was a mutual improvement group with 12 original members composed of workingmen but with a spirit of inquiry and determination to improve.

During Friday evenings, the Junto would meet to converse and discuss their answers to questions that Franklin devised. The topics ranged from personal, intellectual, business and community. Through these discussions, Franklin was able to form brilliant ideas and concepts such as volunteer fire-fighting clubs, night watchmen, and a public hospital.

Thomas Edison and The Vagabonds

In 1914, Henry Ford and John Burroughs took a road trip to visit Thomas Edison at his home in Florida. Little did they know that this would evolve into a series of summer camping trips yearly. Together with Harvey Firestone, they called themselves the Vagabonds.

They camped in style, embarked in road trips, and conducted climbing contests and more. They held campfire sessions to talk about concepts, current events, and issues as well business ventures, which helped them inspire new ideas.

It was in 1924 when the annual trips ended due to many reasons, including the death of Warren G. Harding.
