*Note: If you haven’t seen Avengers: The Infinity War yet, don’t worry. This post does not contain any spoilers. ;)*

Superheroes are strong. No–they’re super-strong. Individually, they can knock out a few bad guys, but they still need to band together as a team in order to save the world.

Now, entrepreneurs may not have superpowers (although we sure would love some!) but if we pool our ideas together, then we can have a better shot at achieving success – and maybe saving the world in the process.

One of the ways we can do that is through a mastermind group.

What is a Mastermind Group?

A mastermind group (also known as accountability group) is popularized by Napoleon Hill in the 1990s as:

The coordination of knowledge and effort of two or more people, who work toward a definite purpose, in the spirit of harmony.

Napoleon goes on to describe a mastermind group in more literal terms, as a process where two or more minds with a common goal combine to create a “third mind”, which serves as a well of inspiration with which the members can use to come up with original ideas.

Since then, there have been quite a few mastermind groups throughout history that propelled brilliant individuals forward. Some noteworthy examples are the Inklings, a group of famous writers during the 20th century of which C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien were members; and the Vagabonds, a camping group that lists Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and even U.S. president Warren Harding as its core members.

In the modern-day world, the most famous example of a mastermind group could probably be seen in the fictional world: none other than the Avengers.

And even though they hail from the comics, let’s see why the Avengers is the ultimate mastermind group that modern-day entrepreneurs should try to emulate.

Each member has his or her own superpowers and special abilities.

To be a member of the Avengers, one must have superpowers or special abilities that make him a valuable part of the team. Iron Man doesn’t have any superpowers, but he wields a high-tech suit that lets him fly and shoot energy beams from his hands and chest. Thor is a demi-god that can channel thunder from the sky with his trusty Mjolnir. And Hulk, well, turns into an unstoppable force that wrecks everyone in his path that gets him angry.

Likewise, to be a part of an online mastermind group for entrepreneurs, one must have have a broad set of skills, with a specialization on a few fields – whether it’s business development, product management, or marketing – thus making each one an indispensable part of the team.

They support each other, making each other better superheroes in the process.

Way back in the first Avengers movie, each member of the Avengers were used to just working alone, with no one to support them and no one to show them how they could’ve done things a little better. And when they had to team up to “solve a bigger problem”, they didn’t hold back any punches. They shared “tough love” with each other, even if it means criticizing another member so he could fight a lot better, or suggesting a better strategy that could improve their role as Earth’s mightiest heroes.

In a similar light, entrepreneurs and business owners use a similar accountability network in the form of business networking groups. This online mastermind group for entrepreneurs serves as the place where constructive feedback and “tough love” helps founders and professionals to improve further and solve problems together.

Together, they’re a powerful super group that can change the world.

Each Avenger has his own story, which gives depth and dimension to their characters. Thor was an arrogant boy who cared only about throwing his hammer around and beating bad guys, but he learned from his father that “A wise king never seeks out war.”

Likewise, each entrepreneur and solopreneur has his own business, which gives each a specific set of knowledge to contribute to the mastermind group. What one lacks, the other can accomplish, which creates synergy between individuals that make the group more effective.

This makes an online mastermind group for entrepreneurs a place to find like-minded individuals who can help you realize your flaws and help you work on them as a team.

Oh, and did I mention that they’re just super awesome?

If there’s one thing we can all agree on, it’s that the Avengers are the most awesome mastermind group ever conceived!

Of course, the Avengers are fictional, but that’s not the point. It’s the teamwork, being able to work alone, yet function even better as a team, which makes mastermind groups a highly interesting concept for entrepreneurs.

Luckily, there are lots of options when looking for an online mastermind group for entrepreneurs. But when choosing a team, take a hint from the Avengers. Pick individuals that you can trust and who has the same goal as you: to change the world.
