> Hi, I'm Rebecca Smith. I'm the owner and Director of [Complete Performance Coaching](https://completeperformancecoaching.com), which is a sports psychology coaching company for kids and teens who are struggling with anxiety or fear in their sport.

#### What were the sort of issues you faced with your business before becoming an OwnersUP member?

Before joining owners up, I was this idea person who could come up with an overwhelming list of ideas and tasks and things that I wanted to do and I had all these big plans, but I would get really lost in the minutia. And I also didn't, I didn't have systems to put all this into place, so I knew I was gonna. I knew I had this great thing, but it wasn't manifesting as quickly because it was hard for me to stay on task and stay goal-oriented.

#### What did that feel like to have those issues?

I always felt great about my ideas. I always felt like I am this amazing idea content machine, but it starts to feel like a dead end when I'm like constantly filling up my list of ideas, ideas, ideas, and then not knowing exactly where to focus and having these things that are like, should I completely change directions? Should I course correct and knowing that I need other opinions before I jump in any direction

#### Can you tell me how you think that would have all played out over time if it had stayed the same?

I know that I'm meant to be successfulâ€”that I'm clear on, but I don't know if it would have been as efficient without the feedback and without the systems. 

#### When was going through your head at the time you came across OwnersUP?

When I came across owners up, a friend of mine had recommended it to me. I was in a different mastermind group and was feeling pretty dissatisfied because I was. I was really enthusiastic. I was really committed and the other people were either not as successful. Not as committed and not as focused. They were not on time. It was just kind of this level of commitment that I didn't. I wasn't getting enough of and so I was looking for something where it'd be more successful people, more direct guidance, more structure.

#### What was your main concern that would have prevented you from joining OwnersUP, and what put your fears to rest?

My main concern was there was a lot of tracking and I am. I'm an ideas person and not a numbers tracking person, so I was like, I don't. This is not. This is not for me tracking, but I saw that Tanya had a ton of success. She had successfully sold businesses. She basically had what I wanted and she's a big fan of tracking and I was like, okay, I will try it.

#### I know that a lot of people are apprehensive when they're starting something new like this. How did YOU find it initially?

My initial resistance was around actually what I wanted, which was the structure, the tracking. I resist it a little bit about, you know, everyone has to be on time and I felt, I felt my own resistance coming up around the structure because, so not a structure person, but once that happened I got all these systems in place that streamlined and I, I basically doubled my income and half of my hours because my system's got so good. So I realized that even though a lot of the stuff that people were guiding me to do is out of my comfort zone, it's what I needed because it's not my zone of genius. So I need other people's ideas sending me in the direction I don't necessarily want to go so I can get more out of myself as a business owner.

#### How did that make you feel to start seeing those results?

MMM. How did it make me feel? No, I wasn't surprised. I wasn't surprised that I started to see better results. Kind of felt like the natural progression of things because I was seeing other people having big successes and I it, it just became kind of the natural flow of what happens in our group.

If you were to recommend OwnersUP to your best friend or anybody, what would you say?

I would say absolutely no question to it. Don't start a business or run a business without a group of smart, successful people keeping an eye on you.

#### What surprised you the most or made you the happiest about joining OwnersUP?

I, let's see what, what surprised me, I think it was that it was coed and the value that brought because I had been a member of women's only groups and I loved having the masculine and feminine represented in a group. And so I'd pull different things from different people in a and having the male perspective on my business that is so female-oriented has been surprisingly valuable.

When I joined owners up, I was a one woman operation. I was control freak. It's hard to be, you know, good at stuff and then let it go and let other people take it on. But I was challenged in a bunch of different ways to start passing things off that I was so attached to. And so I started small and every time I let go my business got bigger. 

I think if you're in a group of people you trust who have what you want, who are successful, it's easy to take the advice and take the leap. If people are giving you advice who are not successful or not committed, it's easy to kind of bat it off, but knowing that these people are successful, they know what they're talking about, they've done it, they've leaped. It made it feel safe for me to do the same.

Part of my business dream was to be able to be present for my kids and when I started I was working three, 10 hour days. Now I work basically two days a week and my income has doubled.
