**Want to Set Yourself Up for Sales Success? Here’s What You Need to Know.**

Being an owner is a far cry from the&nbsp; expertise you developed in your former career.

Instead of focusing on one thing and doing that well, you must prioritize building repeatable and successful systems across all facets of your company. That’s a daunting task when you’ve lived most of your professional life in one wheelhouse.

Of all your business’s systems that need ironing out, sales might just be your top priority.&nbsp;

If that scares you in any shape or form, it’s totally understandable. Not everybody is a salesperson at heart. But success as a founder means overcoming those fears and taking the necessary steps toward growth--even if that means stepping outside your comfort zone.&nbsp;

What’s more, while making this transition, plenty of resources are available to guide you through developing your sales processes.&nbsp;

Read on to find out what you need to do to fine-tune your sales processes as a service-based founder:

**What You Need To Understand About Sales&nbsp;**

***Marketing and Sales Are Two Separate Entities***

Too often, entrepreneurs with non-selling background treat marketing and sales like they’re the same thing.&nbsp; While these two crucial business elements are closely related, they are entirely different.&nbsp;

**Marketing** primarily entails crafting your brand and positioning it in the minds of your prospects.&nbsp;

Lead generation is another core component of marketing. Here, you’re turning people from strangers into prospective buyers of your products or services.

**Sales** occur after marketing during the buyer’s journey.&nbsp;

You’re taking the leads you’ve generated via marketing, then turning them into closed, paying customers. It’s where you secure the deal and provide services to the client, complete the monetary transaction, and actively earn revenue.

Both sales and marketing might be entirely separate entities, but they must work together in harmony. They can’t operate as silos because it creates inconsistencies and a lack of cohesion.

Poor communication between the departments is a far-too-frequent mistake and a lost opportunity to hone both processes. Remember that salespeople are out in the field. They hear firsthand about a buyer’s psychology. As such, your sellers can provide insights to the marketing department about whether lead generation or brand positioning is working.

***Sifting Through Insights and Helping with Decisions***

Despite what the movies tell you, sales isn’t about convincing people they want something. It’s about solving a problem for your target market.

Hollywood needs to tell exciting stories. Sadly, conscientious salespeople who focus on a client’s actual needs don’t create enough conflict, even though it’s the reality of how selling works.

Instead of having a “schtick” or using mind tricks, top-performing salespeople sift through the information they learn about the customers by asking high-quality questions.&nbsp;

By sifting, salespeople identify whether a prospective buyer has a want or need for a product or service. This technique also informs a sales talent whether the prospect is qualified to buy the product. In other words, the seller learns if the lead has the time, money, and desire to make a purchase. Doing so ensures time is invested into qualified prospects instead of being wasted on non-viable leads.

For the above reasons, you’ll notice top-performing sellers don’t chase people around.&nbsp;

Instead, these talents identify purchase potential, then help/guide prospects through the buyer’s journey until they decide to move forward with the product or service. In other words, an excellent seller acts as a trusted advisor or consultant--not a shill. Additionally, by earning a customer’s trust, a salesperson ensures a customer’s repeat business.&nbsp;&nbsp;

***Success with Sales Solves ALL Your Problems&nbsp;***

At the end of the day, the only way your business can thrive is by pulling in revenue--and you do that by making sales. No matter what, selling your products and services in abundance and turning a tidy profit cures anything that’s ailing your business.

Successful sales are at the core of a thriving, growing business. After all, you can’t expand without earning revenue.&nbsp;

***The Elevator Pitch***

Your elevator pitch involves both marketing and sales. You’re positioning yourself in the minds of your target but also beginning the process of selling.

Here’s a template to work with:

“We help ([***target audience***](https://www.marketingevolution.com/marketing-essentials/target-audience)) who are (***present situation***) ([***unique selling proposition***](https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/04/07/unique-selling-proposition)) so they ([***unique value proposition***](https://unbounce.com/conversion-glossary/definition/unique-value-proposition/)***)***.”

You need to be clear about who you help and what you’re doing for them. Be mindful that - odds are - your product or service isn’t for everyone. Therefore, you’re better off spending time catering to a specific audience with the most potential to become your customer or client.

Here are a couple of examples using the same template as above:

**B2B Example (For a Professional Coach/Consulting Service):**

We help business owners manage their schedules, delegate tasks, and create growth strategies so they can keep expanding while having time in their personal lives.

**B2C Example (For a Gym):**

We help young mothers who are looking to improve their overall wellness have a professional caretaker safely watch over their kids at the gym while they exercise so they can be more healthy.

These elevator pitches filter down to a niche, allowing you to really connect or resonate with a specific audience.&nbsp;

Better yet, your sellers won’t waste time chasing people around, trying to convert long-shot leads into customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

An elevator pitch also gives you talking points during your business’s infancy. Here,&nbsp; you’re out there conversing with your potential customers and getting feedback from the marketplace.

**Evolving Your Sales Processes**

I’ve worked with many clients who’ve gone from “self-employed” to a bonafide owner, with a living, breathing business that functions without them.

The journey these people take is always inspiring, but they’ve got to start somewhere. Typically - and especially if they don’t have a selling background - they’re trying to sell in an environment that looks like this:

* The brand isn’t well-known
* No clear understanding of product-market fit or ideal customers
* Non-existent processes, partnerships, or systems that will help with scaling growth
* There aren’t many leads (if there are any at all)

In other words, owners must create selling processes from nothing. And you must evolve your sales to the point where everything you don’t have now is firmly established over the long haul.&nbsp;

***Find Your Sales Ambassador or Architect***

Now, provided you don’t have a knack for sales, trying to create a thriving selling environment yourself without delegating can lead you down a painful path.

You must hire an ambassador or architect to lay your sales foundation. And be exceptionally picky about who you bring on board.

For instance, think twice about hiring someone from corporate sales. They don’t know what it is to start from scratch. Their previous brand was already established. And they had plenty of leads to work with, on top of an internal sales team and professional partnerships. As such, it’s easier to generate sales in this environment.&nbsp;

With that said, what type of person should you hire as an architect or ambassador for sales?

First, whoever you bring on board must be creative, proactive, agile, and hard working.&nbsp;

Your architect must thrive when working without explicit instructions, as they’re developing entire systems from scratch. Also, they can’t fear failing. And they should embrace the state of flux during this experimental phase where you’re learning what works for your business.&nbsp;

Given the trial and error involved, a thick skin is required for your sales ambassadors/architects.

***Wait to Hire Department Leaders***

Don’t worry so much about hiring a sales manager, initially. Your architects can just be outright salespeople. I suggest hiring 2 team members. This way, they can compete, and you can compare their processes.&nbsp;

Then, when your department expands, and your architects have developed the systems, hire a manager.

While you can’t treat your business’s sales department as you would corporate sales at first, it does provide something of a benchmark. All those established qualities of a corporate sales environment - from a well-defined brand to tried-and-tested systems - are where you want to be.&nbsp;

It’s worth pointing out that - similar to corporate sales - your sales growth might stagnate after you’ve expanded. But if you’re pulling in around $5 million in sales revenue, it’s okay to level out just a bit.

**Your Initial Sales Model**

Here’s what your initial sales model should probably look like:

*Direct Sales:&nbsp;*

* At first, it’ll help to partner with 3rd party sales representatives. These are paid contractors and consultants with pre-established networks and skills to get you into more sales channels (e.g., retail networks).

* 3rd party sales representatives let you test your early sales-based hypotheses:
  * As an owner, you’re the first salesperson for your company and should be the one closing the first few big deals. From there, you can begin to experiment with various processes and ideas--3rd party consultants can offer advice and act as your sounding board.&nbsp;

*Internal Sales Team:*

* As your company grows and you develop your sales systems with the help of a 3rd party representative, it’s time to consider expanding your internal team.&nbsp;

* Eventually, you’ll recruit a manager. But start by increasing the number of sales talents working for you.&nbsp;

**The Core KPIs and Metrics of Sales**

***Leads Generated Monthly***

The leads you generate per month are the foundation of your company’s cash flow. Without leads, no deals get closed, and that means no money is coming in.

Leads are people who’ll potentially purchase your services but haven’t yet. For someone to be a lead, you need their contact information (e.g., phone number, email).&nbsp;&nbsp;

***Leads Qualified***

For a lead to be qualified, your sales team must discover if they have the time, money, and desire to pay for your services.&nbsp;

Qualifying a lead might entail a form on your website on which a potential customer provides the necessary information. Or, a salesperson can quickly call a lead to vet them. Either way, you’re figuring out the likelihood that they’ll spend money on your services.

Be mindful that spending time on unqualified leads will cost your business money, making this process integral.&nbsp;

***Proposals/Presentations Sent***

Putting together materials for proposals/presentations helps move sales forward and builds your brand’s credibility. For psychological reasons, third-party material is more effective than what comes out of your mouth.

As such, calculate how many proposals/presentations have been sent out per month that generated successful sales.&nbsp;

***Lead Conversion Rate***

What’s the percentage of leads actually being converted into customers?

***Sales Cycle Length***

How long does it take to get from the first step of the buyer’s journey to someone becoming a paying customer?&nbsp;

The costlier and more complex your services, the longer this cycle will take--it could be weeks or months. Knowing how long this process takes is essential to creating a winning sales system, ensuring the buyer’s journey is neither rushed nor too slow.&nbsp;

***Revenue Generated Monthly***

This is how much money is coming in per month.

***Average Deal Size***

Quantity of sales isn’t quite as valuable as the quality of a sale.

For example, if someone only closes 1 deal per year, but it’s worth 8 figures, they’re doing more for your business than someone who completes dozens of 3 or 4-figure sales per year.

Track the average deal size for both the entire company and individual reps.

**Design a 90-Day Sprint**

Your 90-day sprint is a concentrated effort, spanning 6 days/week at 6 hours/day or 5 days/week at 10 hours/day, etc., depending on what you prefer.

During this process, you’re aiming to rapidly grow revenue for your company. So, start by setting your ‘90-day revenue target.’ For instance, you might be earning $500,000 per year and want to double that in 90 days.&nbsp;

Assuming that you’re adhering to the key sales KPIs, you’ll have plenty of lead-based data. So, take that information and take an educated guess on how many leads you’ll need to reach your 90-day sprint revenue target.&nbsp;

You then need to decide on the daily activities required to reach this revenue goal. Break it down into small pieces.&nbsp;

For example, decide that each rep reaches out to 1,000 leads in the next 90 days. Or, each salesperson might need to qualify 10 leads per day. You’d then want to ensure that they close 2 deals per day.

Specificity is crucial to tracking performance, and therefore, reaching your goal. That means you must be precise about daily numbers of referrals, cold calls/emails, qualified presentations, etc.&nbsp;

Here, I’ll add a disclaimer: don’t perform your 90-day sprint without a solid customer base. This way, you’ll have the necessary metrics that help guide you to a successful sprint.&nbsp;

**How Sales Supports All Other Departments In Your Company&nbsp;**

***Research and Development***

Your salespeople are on the frontlines talking to customers, garnering insights about their wants and needs. This information can help formulate new ideas and add features to your services relevant to your target market.

***Marketing***

Salespeople are finding out the truths about your marketing messages and brand positioning. Based on customers’/leads’ reactions and responses, your sales team can tell you if the marketing strategy is proving effective. Or, they’ll let you know if it’s time to change directions.&nbsp;

Although marketers have various tools to measure their strategies’ effectiveness, salespeople dig that extra bit deeper.&nbsp;

After all, every piece of technology in the world won’t equal insights gleaned from person-to-person interactions.&nbsp;

***Customer Service/Support***

Salespeople interact so much with customers that you could almost mistake them for customer service reps. To that end, your sellers are constantly hearing complaints and gaining insights about frustrations from your client base.&nbsp;

This information can help you correct any mistakes and improve upon weaknesses in how you support customers.&nbsp;

**Who Do You Want to Hire for Sales? And How Much Should You Pay Them?&nbsp;**

***What Qualities Should You Look For in Sales Talent?***

When you begin building your sales team, your success rests upon bringing on talent who’ll thrive in your business’s unique environment. Specifically, you’re a service-based entrepreneur/founder in a line of work rooted in non-stop growth.&nbsp;

With growth comes change, meaning you’ll need creative and agile people who can roll with the punches.

In other words, look for sales talent who can adapt quickly to any situation. You need people who can create solutions when there’s no clear way to solve a problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Aim to recruit salespeople who aren’t afraid of a baptism by fire. They need to embrace being thrown into the jungle, so to speak, and possess a high level of tenacity. Getting ahead in the marketplace is exceptionally tough. And you need hardnosed people at your side, ready to do battle for you.&nbsp;

Leadership is another trait you want in your sales talent.&nbsp;

On the above note, when you start developing your team, the first people you bring on board are the likeliest to rise fastest. The more inherent leadership capabilities your salespeople have, the better they’ll adapt to an eventual increase in responsibilities.&nbsp;

***How Much Should You Pay Your Sales Talent?***

Recruiting top-performing sales talent won’t happen when you’re not willing to compensate accordingly. People who deliver results know what they’re worth and will work elsewhere if you’re offering low-end pay.

Of course, it’s a tricky balance to strike--especially when you’re just starting out a team. You’ve got to be careful how you spend; otherwise, your budget will shrink to nothing.&nbsp;

Before going further, I have one suggestion for you to mull over. Since you’re running a smaller business, think about offering some equity in overall compensation.

&nbsp;With that said, here are 3 ways that salespeople are compensated:

1. *Base + Commission:*

* The base pay is just enough to survive on, which is common in sales. You don’t want to overcommit here since selling is a results-focused profession. And you want to compensate based on performance, not just for showing up.

* Commission is where to be generous--it’s a percentage of the sales revenue generated by a salesperson. Calculate this number based on your industry and your business model.

1. *Base + Bonus:*

* Typically, this compensation model is used after your company has expanded, and it’s more resembles a corporate selling environment.&nbsp;

* Bonuses come into play when quotas and targets are reached.

* Bonuses work better in environments with larger teams because selling at that point is more of a group effort.

1. *Commission Only:*

* This compensation model is for 3rd party representatives/outside salespeople. They don’t work for your company. And they’re only working for a percentage of the revenue their sales generate, not for any base pay.

* You tell these 3rd part sellers the outcome you want, and they do their best to uphold that agreement. But you can’t supervise them as you would an employee.

***Mistakes to Avoid***

This biggest blunder made by entrepreneurs piecing together their sales team is hiring based on someone’s resume instead of mindset and skillset. Pay attention to how your sales team candidates think--not what’s written on a piece of paper. Don’t get lured by an MBA, for instance. Because it doesn’t mean someone can close a deal.&nbsp;

To the above point, don’t bother starting with an interview. Have an initial testing process to ensure you’re only interviewing quality candidates.&nbsp;

Also, as I touched upon before, failing to understand appropriate compensation for salespeople will cost you. Your best people will leave if you’re even able to attract top talent in the first place.

And don’t balk at investing in the growth and expansion of your sales team.&nbsp;

While it’s scary to invest significantly into acquiring talent at first, it’s the only way your business will make any meaningful impact. Risk is part of your role as an owner--and sabotaging yourself with a shoestring budget will ensure your company stays stagnant.&nbsp;
