When you lose a client what do you do? Probably like most entrepreneurs you are annoyed and then you mark as a loss. But do you know the reason why you lost? Have you ever thought of calling them back and finding out?

One of member Jason does he learned so much from finding out.

This is the email he uses (FYI- as an OwnersUP you get what all templates that worked for members.)

**Subject:**

*I’m working on my sales process getting in contact with people who I met with recently. I wanted to get your feedback on how I can improve and what we can do better as a company. Do you have 10 minutes to talk?*

*If it makes sense, how does your calendar look?*

*Then when you get them on the phone, ask them..*

*Just so I can understand better, why did you not end up moving forward with us?*

*If they picked someone else, ask them what was it they liked about their offering. Why did you decide to go with them?*

*How can I improve my process?*

*How can we improve our offering?*

*Although they didn’t buy, they can be amazing teachers.*

Go on find out why you lost them!
