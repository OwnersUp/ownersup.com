On the surface, delegating sounds like it should be easy and stress-free.&nbsp;

You’re creating less low-value work for yourself and freeing up your time to focus on more important things. So, why would it be challenging? Someone else is shouldering the load, which should relieve some of the burdens weighing you down as a business owner.&nbsp;

And when you do happen to delegate effectively, the benefits seem to never end. Your life is made simpler. Plus, you aren’t drowning in a sea of work.

However, you don’t experience those perks just because you’ve decided to delegate. There are entire worlds of differences between effective and ineffective delegation.&nbsp;

Like communicating, selling, marketing, etc., delegating is a skill you develop over time. It’s a muscle you build. While some people might have a knack for it, most business owners have to learn to delegate.

The delegation learning curve leads to a lot of frustration for small business owners. Because they don’t get the desired results right away--but it takes time and patients to master.

**Don’t Get Too Stuck in a DIY Mindset.**

In my experience coaching entrepreneurs, I’ve noticed one crucial mistake that halts delegation efforts. Many owners fail to clearly state their expectations, nor do they say what’s in their heads. Then they’re left thinking that their teams don’t have common sense and end up doing all the work themselves.&nbsp;

While the DIY spirit is admirable, it’s short-sighted. When your company can’t exist without you, it’s not as much a business as it is a side hustle or just another job.

Plus, doing everything yourself will rob you of your personal time and adversely impact your overall quality of life.

I’ll say it plainly: all business owners must delegate. So, whether you’re nervous about delegating tasks or you’ve tried to delegate before and failed, read this article and learn how to be an effective delegator:&nbsp;

**Why Should Delegation Be a Top Priority?**

You own a small, service-based business. You don’t have a gigantic staff of people at the ready and probably don’t employ more than 10 people--if it’s not just you by yourself.

With such little manpower, you’re bound to get swallowed up by work. In which case, how are you supposed to get everything done?

You’re an owner. Therefore, you must be very particular about the work you do. Your focus should be on big-picture objectives and high-level issues with clients. You can’t get stuck on every little nut and bolt. Then you won’t have time to focus on what’s most important.

For instance, you’re far better off spending your day brokering partnerships that help expand your company than - let’s say - writing blogs.

You can pay someone a very affordable fee or hire an employee to write content for you. But only you can represent your brand in brokering a crucial partnership for your business.

In the above example, brokering the partnership is working ON your business.&nbsp;

Conversely, blog-writing is working IN your business. Sure, content production is valuable--but it’s also one-dimensional and specific to the task itself.&nbsp;

I’ll take this example further and say that a higher-value job related to blog-writing would be deciding the direction of your overall content strategy. From there, you would delegate the technical writing aspect to someone else.&nbsp;

Either way, your focus must be your company itself and turning it into a self-sustaining machine that could thrive without you around. Even if you got hit by a bus.

**What Are the Main Obstacles Preventing Owners from Delegating Effectively?**

**Micromanaging Your Workers**

Okay. I want you to imagine you’ve begun your delegation journey.&nbsp;

You made the necessary moves and have either outsourced a project to a freelancer/contractor or hired a new employee.&nbsp;

What’s the first thing you can do that can send this new relationship flying off the rails? Micromanaging and breathing down someone’s neck as they try to get the job done.&nbsp;

In the spirit of course correction, I’ll leave a[**link to a Harvard Business Review article**](https://hbr.org/2021/01/how-to-help-without-micromanaging) about how to prevent yourself from micromanaging. This way, you’ll have a blueprint to stop you from committing one of the gravest leadership errors you can make

There is psychology that you’re fighting against. There’s something inside the human brain pushing us toward micromanaging. It stems from something called the “faith in supervision effect.”&nbsp;

This “effect” results from the inability to let go, and thinking work performed under strict supervision will be done better than if you aren’t rigidly supervising.

Micromanagement also creates extra low-value work for you, chewing more into your schedule than if you did the job yourself. Don’t spend all that time watching over someone you’ve hired to lighten your load. I can assure you, as an owner, you have a million better things to do than micromanage.&nbsp;

**Thinking You Can Do it Better Yourself**

There’s another psychological bias called “the self-enhancement effect.” You end up thinking work is executed better when you’re involved. Falling into this trap means drowning yourself in low-value technical tasks, spending 80 hours a week working in a stagnant business.&nbsp;

Sure. In the here and now, it might be easier to DIY a given task. But succumbing to that immediate need is the very essence of short-term thinking.

Instead, you must think big picture. You can’t scale your business doing everything yourself. Alternatively, training someone to do the task might be more difficult in the short term. But it will pay long-term dividends and free your time so you can expand your enterprise.

**You’re Anxious About Trusting Someone Else**

I’m a business owner, so I am very familiar with the struggle of letting go and trusting someone else to do the work.

Your business is like your baby. You’re passionate about it and don’t want to leave it vulnerable to the lurking dangers out there in the real world.

I then have to ask: what happens when parents overly coddle their children? Often, these kids grow up to rely on their parents for every little thing. Do you want the same thing from your business? When you don’t let go, you’re not showing confidence in your systems and culture. And your company will never mature beyond its infancy.

At first, it will be hard to let go. That protectiveness of your brand is natural as an owner.&nbsp;

But take solace in knowing that the people you hire WANT to do good work. This notion rings doubly true when you’re transparent about how passionate you are about your business. When other professionals see how committed you are, they’ll want to do right by you.&nbsp;

Beyond that, trust your judgment and ability to vet and train talent.&nbsp;

You’re not going to bring an employee or freelancer on board who sinks the ship. You have the good sense to hire qualified professionals who’ll get the delegated jobs done right.&nbsp;

**Being Scared Away By One Bad Experience**&nbsp;

I hear a story from many of my clients that they tried delegating or outsourcing once, and the whole thing was a mess. Due to this less-than-ideal experience, they believe DIYing every little thing is the solution to all their problems.

On a related note, one of my most cherished accomplishments as a professional coach is helping course-correct delegation-averse clients.

Often, I use the example below to get through to my clients most hesitant to delegate:

Imagine going on a date. During this experience, your date doesn’t laugh at your jokes. And they “conveniently” forgot their wallet after ordering lobster and steak. Of course, you run for the hills and never call this person back. But do you give up on dating altogether? I’d hope not\!

Given that it’s literally impossible to grow your business without delegating tasks, you can’t afford to let one bad experience steer you away from it.

Similar to dating, over time, you fine-tune your vetting process when delegating tasks. You’ll also improve how you delegate, whether through your communication or by better defining your expectations.&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Define Your Delegation Criteria**

Delegating must be a defined system or process with criteria similar to other core business functions.&nbsp;

Here’s another way to look at it:

Suppose for a moment, instead of being service-based, you sold a variety of paints and paintbrushes. Wouldn’t you have a plan to both procure and distribute those products? Trying to wrangle that part of your business on the fly would guarantee your immediate failure.

The same can be said for delegation. It’s not something you can make up as you go.&nbsp;

Here are the criteria I use to delegate work:

* **First, Delegate Your “Energy Sucking” Work:**
  * This is the work you don’t like and aren’t good at.

* **Second, Delegate Your “Low Impact” Work:**
  * While you’re ‘okay’ at these tasks, you don’t enjoy them. And they don’t really impact your business that much.

* **Third, Delegate Your “Joyless” Work:**
  * You’re very good at this work, it’s vital to your business, but it gives you no pleasure.

* **DON’T Delegate Your “Thriving Work:**
  * You’re really awesome at these tasks, you enjoy the work involved, and they have a tremendous impact on your business.

With all the work being delegated, you also need to weigh how long it takes to complete the related tasks. This way, you’ll find out how much the specific jobs are chewing into your more critical duties.&nbsp;

You also must figure out how much money it costs to delegate each task and weigh it against your budget. As much as delegation is 100% necessary, it needs to be financially sound.

Furthermore, define whether tasks are one-time or recurring.&nbsp;

Provided a task is recurring, you’ll want to prioritize it since it needs constant attention. With one-time jobs, primarily, you’ll need to pay them special attention when they’re time-sensitive.

**Another Way to View Delegation Criteria&nbsp;**

While the criteria I provided is how I help my clients delegate, I’ll offer you another way to audit your tasks and prioritize what should be given to others. It’s always wise to look at different methods, then decide what works best for you:

*T*he *Snowballs:*

These tasks are minor. And they don’t take much time to complete. But they can keep piling up over time until you’re dealing with an avalanche of supposedly small jobs.&nbsp;

A few examples of this task type are:

* Scheduling meetings
* Deleting spam/marketing emails
* Sending out invoices

These jobs can potentially be delegated to an assistant.

*The Sleep Inducers:*

These tasks require little brainpower, and you can do them half-asleep. An example of this work is copy and pasting leads from a marketing tool to your CRM.

Since such jobs don’t require any real skill, they tend to be easy and cheap to delegate.

*The Day Devourers:*

Day-devouring tasks chew into your time and are best managed by being broken into smaller chunks. That involves delegating parts of the work to freelancers, contractors, or employees.

Try handing off bits and pieces of recurring work that typically eats into your time, so you can free up your schedule every day for other crucial tasks.

*The Teacher’s Pets:*

There’s specific work out there that lends itself to teaching. Figure out which tasks can quickly be taught to and learned by your team members or a freelancer, and you’ll have even more jobs off your plate.

This category doesn’t include tasks that require your specific expertise. That will take too long and requires its own unique process.&nbsp;

*The Far Reaches:*

You might - for instance - find yourself spending eight hours trying to design a banner for your blog when it’d take a pro designer one hour.&nbsp;

In this scenario, you’re costing your company so much more than what it would cost for a design specialist. Because you’re wasting countless hours and effort fumbling around with graphics when you should be working ON your business.&nbsp;

Look to delegate skilled work that’s well outside your depth to the industry specialists.

*The Pressure Cookers:*

High-pressure, time-sensitive projects go hand-in-hand with being a business owner. Sometimes, though, you’re going to need some help along the way to meet the deadline. At the very least, you’ll have to delegate components of these tasks to team members or freelancers.

**Giving Up What You Love**

The ownership journey evolves constantly. There’s no knowing what the demands of your role will be ten months from now. After all, change is inevitable if you’re doing the right things and always seeking out growth opportunities.

While evolution and growth are both exciting prospects, they can be double-edged swords.&nbsp;

As you pivot and adjust to shifting business demands, your list of responsibilities will transform, too. Meaning it might no longer make sense for you to keep performing specific tasks you enjoy. Now, this is a tricky spot to be in. The whole point of running your own business is to have the freedom to do what you want.

So, when enjoyable work becomes less of an ownership duty, still try making a bit of time for it.

An example that comes to mind is when somebody becomes a school principal. These are passionate educators who love teaching. But the desire for career growth has led them to the administrative end of the spectrum.

Now, if this school principal truly loves teaching, you can bet your bottom dollar they’ll sneak in a few substitute lessons when teachers call in sick.&nbsp;

My point being, you might have to say goodbye to work you love as an everyday constant. But that doesn’t mean you can’t make extra time for those tasks to feed your spirit.

**The Keys to Successful Delegation**

**Decide What Work You Should Delegate**

Consider anywhere between three to five tasks that are most vital to your company’s future. For context, provided you spent 80% of your time doing this work, your business would grow rapidly and exponentially.&nbsp;

Then write all the remaining tasks you perform--the types of jobs that pull you away from higher-level work. This work doesn’t impact your company’s growth. It has you working IN your business as an employee, not ON your business as an owner.&nbsp;

Calculate how much time those lower-level tasks are taking from you. That number can serve as a framework for your delegation plan.&nbsp;

You can then budget both time and money based on how much time lower-level tasks take.&nbsp;

**Finding the Right Person for the Job**

Being a successful delegator relies heavily on understanding the workers and skillsets you should be looking for.

Otherwise, you’ll end up trying to fit square pegs into round holes, and none of your outsourcing efforts will be successful. Even worse, you might convince yourself that it is, in fact, “easier” to just do everything yourself.

An owner’s most valuable trait is[**matching the right person with the right job**](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rebeccaskilbeck/2019/10/29/3-ways-to-identify-the-best-person-for-the-role/). You need to define factors such as what the job requires (e.g., writing, programming, analysis, selling) and its level of difficulty.

Ask yourself questions such as, “do I need a detail-oriented person?” or “do I need someone creative?” Maybe you’re outsourcing admin work, in which organizational skills are a top necessity.

Furthermore, establish criteria that allow your team or freelancers to be successful. All parties involved need to know what success looks like in the role, or else it amounts to a guessing game.

Communication is another crucial factor in matching the right person with the right job.&nbsp;

Using myself as an example, I utilize videos because it’s more efficient and time-sensitive than writing everything down. So, I need to delegate tasks to people who can take those videos and run with them. But that’s how I operate--you need to consider your preferences with communication and finding a person who fits your mold.

You might - for instance - prefer writing everything down. In which case, you’ll desire someone who works well with details and checklists.&nbsp;

**Explain Why You’re Delegating a Task**

As the old saying goes, context is king. And while a task’s “how,”&nbsp; “what,” and “when” of a job provide some context, they pale in comparison to “why.”

People need to see purpose in their work, even if it’s a very menial task. They need to know the value of the work they’re doing. Tell them why you need the job done and convey how they’re helping your business grow.&nbsp;

**The Feedback Loop**

As your business grows, the more complicated and challenging the delegated tasks will get.&nbsp;

Suddenly, you won’t only be outsourcing straightforward administrative duties and other bare-bones technical work. You’ll graduate to delegating high-level projects because of how much you’ve expanded.

It’s at this stage where a well-crafted feedback loop is 100% necessary.&nbsp;

Start by scheduling a check-in time, whether it’s through a chat on Slack or a video conference. This way, the employee or freelancer can tell you about any struggles or roadblocks, and they can ask you questions if need be.

Don’t make these check-ins too frequent because then it turns into micromanaging.&nbsp;

Instead, schedule these interactions just enough to make yourself accessible and keep informed about progress (or lack thereof).

**Looking Over the Work**

After the due date, you should check the work and provide helpful notes when necessary.

People don’t always do the job right the first time. Even technical experts aren’t entirely familiar with your specific needs, preferences, and culture when they start out. They need time to adjust.

For the above reasons, when an employee or freelancer starts working with you, schedule more frequent feedback sessions to look over their work.

But as you build trust, these encounters can happen less often--maybe once per month.&nbsp;

Scheduling a specific time to check in ensures the project keeps moving forward and that you - the owner - don’t become the bottleneck. You don’t want everybody waiting on your approvals.

**Delegate Authority On Top of Responsibilities&nbsp;**

A typical roadblock for employees and freelancers is not knowing what they are - and aren’t - allowed to do. Maybe they’re given a goal or objective but are left unsure about their authority when making decisions.

Consider this example:

Imagine tasking an employee with buying 40 pens.

Ideally, this task should be completed with few - if any - questions asked. But only being told to buy 40 pens without further guidelines could lead your employee astray.&nbsp;

Someone afraid to ruffle feathers will keep coming back to you and asking if it’s okay before making each purchase. At that point, you may as well buy them yourself. Alternatively, someone unafraid to take the initiative might purchase the most expensive pens on the market and blow through your budget.

Here’s what you should do with this example:

Start by explaining why you need the pens to add context. Then you should offer a price point. So, it’s not just “I need 40 pens.” It’s, “I need 40 pens under $2 each.”&nbsp;

You’ve now provided enough criteria for your employee to make the purchase decision on their own.&nbsp;

**Providing a Task Framework**

Your task framework should look something like this:

* **Goal:**
  * The purpose of the task

* **Why:**
  * The context behind the tasks

* **The Task Itself:**
  * Usually, this is video, audio, or written instructions

* **Timing:**
  * Is this frequent, recurring work or a one-time thing?

* **The “Definition of Done:”**
  * What does the completed task look like? What are your expectations?

* **Reporting/Check-in:**
  * What type of platform will you use for check-ins?&nbsp;
  * Clarify what’s expected at these check-ins and what you’re looking for during these encounters.

* **Tools:**
  * The equipment and resources required to get the work done.

* **Due Date:**
  * The deadline of when the work must be complete.&nbsp;

With this task framework, you stop yourself from micromanaging.&nbsp;

You’ve created a system that allows you to trust you’ve set an employee or freelance up for success without the need for constant supervision. Yet, you’re still checking in and ensuring everything is going according to plan, so you won’t be caught off-guard by the task or project falling apart.&nbsp;

**Use a Password Management Tool**

Delegating can become an enormous headache when the pathways to steady and streamlined workflow are closed off.

For instance, when freelancers or employees don’t have passwords to necessary programs, they can’t do the work. They then have to send you a message, wait for you to get back to them, and only get started when they hear from you.

Don’t commit this unforced error. It wastes time. And, more importantly,&nbsp; it’s an easy fix. All you need is a password manager such as[**1Password**](https://1password.com/).

**Use a Project Management Tool**

What’s the happy medium between micromanaging and being detached from your business?

The answer is awareness.&nbsp;

You don’t need to follow employees, freelancers, and contractors around. You just need to know what’s happening with the delegated projects.&nbsp;

A project management tool (e.g.,[**Trello**](https://trello.com/en),[**ClickUp**](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/clickup)) will keep you informed about every stage of a task, whether it’s new, in progress, in review, or closed/completed. Using these tools ensures no projects slip through the cracks and empowers your teams to complete their work independently without your constant supervision.

**The Importance of Training**

Training deserves its own section because of its impact on your business’s long-term growth and your ability to delegate.

I also want to emphasize training because so many owners believe only they can do the work for their business.&nbsp;

Perhaps, attaching yourself to this DIY philosophy results from the entire system being created based on your individual skillset. It’s a totally understandable problem because you’ve built the whole thing from the ground up. And your company is a 100% reflection and illustration of your thought processes and personality traits. &nbsp;&nbsp;

But that’s no excuse not to delegate.&nbsp;

Part of being an owner means bringing your vision to life--and that doesn’t begin and end with your products. It also includes your systems.

You must establish your processes and communicate them in a manner that allows them to be learned by others.

***The Logic Behind Training***

In the short term, establishing a training method or system is scary and daunting.&nbsp;

It also seems backward at first. You’re trying to free up time, but learning how to train people - and building a system - will only serve to further pack your schedule to the brim.&nbsp;

I understand at the surface that a training system isn’t immediately profitable. You can’t put it in a box or bottle and sell it. So it could mean spending hundreds of hours hammering out a final product that doesn’t generate direct revenue. What’s more, the rest of your tasks keep piling up, pulling you further away from developing these processes.

But your training system could end up being one of the most valuable aspects of your company. And it embodies the idea of working ON your business versus IN your business.

Specifically, a training system has a chain reaction effect where you end up with less and less low-value work as the owner.

Here’s how it should play out:

After training a freelancer or an employee, you now have a trusted person you can delegate to. From there, your company grows. You can afford to employ more people to whom you can delegate more work, including training new talent on your behalf.&nbsp;

This all brings to mind an old saying: give someone a fish, and they’ll enjoy a nice meal. Teach someone to fish, and they’ll eat for a lifetime.

So, yes--doing the more low-value work yourself might get it done quicker today. But learning how to train people and establishing a repeatable training system is something that will feed your business for a lifetime.

**Conclusion: Turning Yourself Into a High-Level Delegator Will Take Your Business to Soaring Heights&nbsp;**

A hard-working, do-it-yourself personality likely guided you this far. Therefore, it feels unnatural to let go, back off, and allow someone else to do the work.

Well, it’s time to leave your comfort zone and learn this vital ownership skill.

Because delegation and empowering people to execute tasks for you is the only way to be a successful owner for the long haul.&nbsp;

With others working on lower-level tasks, you can focus on the high-level, high-value tasks intended for an owner. In other words, once you’ve turned yourself into an expert delegator, you can finally focus on the work you NEED to do to help your business reach its full potential.&nbsp;

&nbsp;
