Imagine this: You’re building a business.
{: .present-before-paste}

Your schedule? JAM packed.
{: .present-before-paste}

It’s Wednesday. Oh look, you have your weekly group call, where you navigate challenges and uncover blind spots in your business.
{: .present-before-paste}

You start to get nervous. You’re trembling. You can’t help it.
{: .present-before-paste}

It’s not even because of the actual call. That part’s only an hour. And it’s with people you like. People who know you and what you’re trying to build.
{: .present-before-paste}

No. You’re nervous about what happens if you’re late…
{: .present-before-paste}

The rules are simple. They’re there to hold everybody accountable. **If you’re late, you SING.** In front of the whole group.
{: .present-before-paste}

The idea of singing in front of others really bothers you. So much so that you’re never even late to begin with. In fact, most weeks you make a habit out of being ten minutes early…
{: .present-before-paste}

### *“But what if today’s the day?”*

It’s not, but even if it was, would it really be that bad?
{: .present-before-paste}

No. You just have a problem with the idea because it makes you feel uncomfortable, and **uncomfortable** is bad. Always.
{: .present-before-paste}

Right?
{: .present-before-paste}

### How (Un)Comfortability Leads to Growth

Singing in front of the entire group when late is an actual rule we enforce in group meetings at **[Owners^UP](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fownersup.com%2F){: target="_blank"}**.
{: .present-before-paste}

Why? Because it helps members form good habits. And, it helps them **push their comfort zones**.
{: .present-before-paste}

Accountability is good. Teamwork is good. Rules can even be good, too. But being too comfortable in your business? That is always bad.
{: .present-before-paste}

People often set goals that they’re comfortable with.
{: .present-before-paste}

One of our members, Dan, runs an architectural imaging company. His comfort lies in design. Making things look really nice. The problem: Before joining Owners^UP, things like sales, cold-calling, and prospecting were never on his goal list.
{: .present-before-paste}

That was before.
{: .present-before-paste}

Now, those things are always on his goal list, and the difference is he’s actually getting sales. He’s being held accountable. Or, he’ll sing songs.
{: .present-before-paste}

Like I said, most people set comfortable goals. It’s like thinking you need to make a business card or build out a full website before launching your business. You don’t. Just start selling. Build the rest as you go.
{: .present-before-paste}

Another good example of pushing your comfort zone is the 20-day YouTube Challenge we did with our Owners^UP members. Everybody in the group agreed to post a video each weekday for a month. It was easier for some than others, but the idea was that, collectively, everybody would move forward.
{: .present-before-paste}

If it weren’t for the “challenge” aspect, we all know what would happen. It’d be a game of ‘someday, one day’ and people would find every excuse in the book to not post a video. The other thing that would happen is people would settle into perfection mode. They’d obsess over the tiny details.
{: .present-before-paste}

Those things just don’t matter. Growth does.
{: .present-before-paste}

Don’t get lost in the busy work. Set up (**[or join](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fownersup.com%2Fapply){: target="_blank"}**) calls like these, prioritize them, and move your company forward.
{: .present-before-paste}

### The Next Step: Taking Action
{: .present-before-paste}

For some people, they hear and absorb the advice they get in these groups, get uncomfortable from time to time, then do nothing.
{: .present-before-paste}

The first step is accountability. The next is **action**.
{: .present-before-paste}

Once you’re uncomfortable, ask yourself: what are those bigger goals, bigger risks, or bigger things you’re willing to do on a daily basis? How is what you’re currently doing impacting your business? Consider (and do) those things to move your business forward.
{: .present-before-paste}

Then, getting uncomfortable becomes a habit.
{: .present-before-paste}

Take Juliana for example. For her, getting uncomfortable meant posting a video of herself. She actively avoided it. Then, her group told her why she’d be great. She gained a bit of confidence, and everybody suddenly got excited for an update on her next call.
{: .present-before-paste}

Then, she acted. She posted a video. She got out from behind her initial fear. Now, she routinely holds chats over Facebook Live.
{: .present-before-paste}

Take action. Get comfortable being uncomfortable. Then, keep going. If you start to plateau, you’ll start to fall back into your comfort zone. And you won’t even realize it’s happening.
{: .present-before-paste}

### *You always need somebody to push you.*
{: .present-before-paste}

Once you push your comfort in one area, you can do it in other areas. Mastered sales? Move onto marketing. It’s as simple as that.
{: .present-before-paste}

Create the habit of becoming uncomfortable. Your comfort zone will expand. Your business will grow.
{: .present-before-paste}

### My Challenge to You
{: .present-before-paste}

Once you recognize and come to grips with the fact that you’re deep in your comfort zone, it’s time to take the necessary measures to escape it.
{: .present-before-paste}

Here is what I challenge you to do:
{: .present-before-paste}

1. **Find a group of people to form your team**. Together, you’ll help one another push yourselves outside of each and every comfort zone.{: .present-before-paste}
2. **Create a challenge within the group**. Similar to the 20-day YouTube Challenge, put a list of rules together and stick to them.{: .present-before-paste}
3. **Keep each other accountable**. This could mean everything from holding weekly check-ins to built-in consequences for those who don’t act. Do what needs to be done.{: .present-before-paste}

If you can do the things listed above and challenge yourselves as a team, everyone in your group will grow.
